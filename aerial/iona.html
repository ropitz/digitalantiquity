 <p>In this map you see an 'AP' layer that shows an air photo of part of Iona. You'll also see a 'SVF' layer that was created from airborne lidar data and represents the shape of the ground. Archaeologists often use aerial images like these to try and identify and interpret archaeological features in the landscape. Use the tools on the left side of the screen to draw archaeological features you think you see. You'll probably want to zoom quote a bit. You'll notice as you draw using the line tool that the length of the features is noted in meters. Pay attention to the size of your features when making interpretations! You may want to switch back and forth between layers using the control in the upper right corner. Once you have drawn all the archaeological features you think you recognize, save your work by printing the page as a pdf or capturing the screen.</p>
