	    <h2> Air Photo Interpretation Exercise</h2>
	<p>Summer 2018 was a good season for cropmarks and air photos. As you may have heard, the unusually hot and dry weather stresses out plants as they grow. When archaeological features are buried they can affect the growth rate of the crops above them. The presence of features such as buried wall foundations or compacted floor surfaces produce a reduction in the soil depth and lower moisture levels than the surrounding land. Crops immediately above these features tend to have reduced growth rates in comparison to the plants above of no archaeological activity, producing “negative cropmarks”.</p>

<p>In contrast areas where ditches, pits and other features have been dug into the subsoil become filled over time. This relative increase in soil depth and the potential to provide increased soil moisture enables the crops above to grow higher and ripen later than the plants around them, producing “positive cropmarks”.  Both negative and positive cropmarks are more easily detected from the air and are usually visible during times of drought when crops are at maximum stress.</p>

 <p>In this map you see an air photo ('AP') layer that shows an air photo of part of Iona. You'll also see a sky view factor visualisastion ('SVF') layer that was created from airborne lidar data and represents the shape of the ground. You can learn more about lidar <a href="http://www.arcland.eu/capture/lidar"> here</a>.</p> 
 <p>Archaeologists often use aerial images like these to try and identify and interpret archaeological features in the landscape. Use the tools on the left side of the screen to draw archaeological features you think you see. You'll probably want to zoom quite a bit. You'll notice as you draw using the line tool that the length of the features is noted in meters. Pay attention to the size of your features when making interpretations! Think about what size a house is, or how wide a road is and consider this when identifying potetial archaeological features. You may want to switch back and forth between layers using the control in the upper right corner.</p> <p>Once you have drawn all the archaeological features you think you recognize, save your work by printing the page as a pdf or capturing the screen.</p>
